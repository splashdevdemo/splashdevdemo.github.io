                Is a secured term loan for you?

                    <p>A secured term loan is the classic method of getting funding for your business. Secured term loans are loans provided for a fixed time period that are ‘secured’ by a physical asset that is owned by the business or one of its directors and has an assessable value. This asset is often referred to ‘collateral’ or ‘security’. Common forms of collateral used for secured term loans include residential property, commercial property, vehicles, machinery or other equipment. The key feature of a secured loan is that it is backed by collateral as part of the lending agreement. Lenders will charge a lower interest rate and provide the facility for a longer time relative to other business loan products as secured term loans are inherently less risky as the lender has a relatively clear way to recover any potential losses by taking possession of the asset.</p>

                      These are the advantages of a secured term loan: defined payment structure, suitable for multiple purposes, lower monthly payments, and lower payment terms. These are the disadvantages of a secured term loan: have to provide security, potential prepayment penalties.

                New car: lease or buy?
            </div>

                        The biggest benefit of leasing a car rather than buying it is that you can usually get a better car for your money by leasing. A lease involves paying the depreciation on the car rather than the entire purchase price. Leasing also benefits drivers who don't have much money saved up for a down payment.

                        Here is a plan to rebuild your credit. First, check your credit report. Know where you are financially be requesting the registers at Equifax. Then, arrange to catch up on your payments. You need to fulfill your obligations to rebuild your credit. Once you've paid your dues, it is time to start moving forward. Avoid closing credit card accounts: the longer your credit history, the better your score. As long as you are not too far behind in your payments, you should be able to keep them. Plan for the future and cultivate healthy financial habits, so you don't need to rebuild your credit again.

                Purchase life insurance &mdash; you aren't too young!

                        Life insurance is essential, no matter how young or old you are. And for millennials, buying now may be a smart move because it’s cheaper to buy a life insurance policy when you’re young and healthy. This kind of insurance can help your family cover unexpected costs in your absence, including student loan debt or a mortgage, in addition to end-of-life costs. And if you have kids, a life insurance policy can also support their education or childcare expenses. Additionally, every millennial should consider long-term disability coverage, which helps you stay afloat financially if an accident happens and you become disabled and unable to work.
