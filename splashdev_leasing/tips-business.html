                    <p>A line of credit is a loan facility that can readily be drawn down or repaid back at any time within a pre-determined limit. This key feature means a line of credit behaves much like a credit card or an overdraft, but rather than being linked to a card or a bank account, it is its own standalone facility.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Like a credit card or an overdraft, interest is only charged on any amount that is drawn and the funds can be drawn down or repaid back at any time. Your company can get <strong>from $2,000 to $250,000+</strong> with a line of credit.

                        These are the advantages of a line of credit: super flexible, only pay interest on funds used, funding available when needed, suitable for a multiple purposes, no security for small balances, great way to build credit score, and simple application process. These are the disadvantages of a line of credit: may require long trading history, can include unexpected fees, may require security, higher rates for lower credit, and may require director’s guarantee.

                        Don’t assume your bank or the equipment manufacturer’s captive finance company will offer the best terms. The majority of equipment leases are done by equipment lease providers. Always compare rates, lease terms, fees and options.

                        As your business grows, you might outgrow your basic BOP and need to consider some other options. Hanley said that usually when businesses start growing to multiple locations or producing a large volume of products, it’s time to look into some other options beyond just the BOP that you started out with.

                       You need to insure your employees too. Workers’ compensation requirements vary by state, but you may be forced to have this type of coverage for your employees. And even if it’s not a legal requirement, it may be a good idea depending on the type of work your team members are tasked with.

                What is an equipment loan or chattel mortgage?

                    <p>
                        Think of this as a regular loan, where the lender gives you cash to buy an asset and then takes that asset as security for if you fail to repay the loan. This is how an equipment loan or chattel mortgage works. The lender will give you the cash to purchase the equipment then use the equipment as security for the money you are borrowing from them.

                        Equipment loans and chattel mortgages are popular methods of financing new pieces of equipment. Chattel mortgages or equipment loans get favourable GST treatment – as you are making the full purchase upfront you can claim back any GST input credit in full at the time of purchase &mdash; this becomes especially valuable on larger purchases. But equipment loans often have higher credit quality requirements and can require more contribution upfront. Equipment loans also tend to have higher fees compared to hire-purchase or leases, as setting up the equipment loan costs the lender more time and documentation compared to the other types of equipment financing.

                        Every business owner wants to run a profitable business, but few entrepreneurs dedicate enough time to measure results. The only way to do this is to have a dedicated accounting function. Good financial decisions can't happen without paying attention to the numbers. It might seem like you can "get along" without accurate accounting during the good times, but it is impossible to navigate lean months without clear financial records..
